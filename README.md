[See my interactive vizualization here!](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticAnalysisWorkbook_2/CyclisticUserAnalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link  )

## Scenario
You are a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, **your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently**. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with **compelling data insights and professional data visualizations**.

## The Business Task
Identify how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## The Data
The data consists of 12 months of real world data, anonymized and made publicly available here. The data is first party and collected automatically by Chicago-based bike-sharing company named Divvy.

**Columns**:

- ride_id
- rideable_type
- started_at
- ended_at
- start_station_name
- start_station_id
- end_station_name
- end_station_id
- start_lat
- start_lng
- end_lat
- end_lng
- member_casual

After downloading and organizing the data, we will need to combine all 12 months into a single dataset.

First, I will clear any previous attempts:

`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS all_trips;`

Then, I will combine the data into a new table

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS all_trips AS
SELECT * FROM '202206_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202207_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202208_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202209_divvy_publictripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202210_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202211_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202212_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202301_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202302_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202303_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202304_divvy_tripdata'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM '202305_divvy_tripdata';`
```

Now, I check to see if it worked – it did:

`SELECT * FROM all_trips;`

Next, I check the total number of rows in the dataset:

`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips;`

There are 5,829,030 rows of data.

## Processing the Data
First, I will check the data for any duplicate entries

```
SELECT COUNT(ride_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT ride_id) AS duplicates
FROM all_trips;
```

Finding no duplicates, I check each column for any empty cells:

```
-- To detect empty cells:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE ride_id == '';             -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE rideable_type == '';       -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE started_at == '';          -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE ended_at == '';            -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE start_station_name == '';  -- 834,545 empty cells detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE start_station_id == '';    -- 834,677 empty cells detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE end_station_name == '';    -- 891,757 empty cells detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE end_station_id == '';      -- 891,898 empty cells detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE start_lat == '';           -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE start_lng == '';           -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE end_lat == '';             -- 5,961 empty cells detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE end_lng == '';             -- 5,961 empty cells detected
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM all_trips WHERE member_casual == '';       -- 0
```

Finding nearly 1M empty cells, I will be sure to filter them.

But first, I’ll check the length of each ride_id to verify consistency and accuracy:

`SELECT DISTINCT(LENGTH(ride_id)) FROM all_trips;`

All ride_id values are 16 characters long without exception.

Next, I will check how many different values for member_casual there are, ensuring there are no invalid entries.

`SELECT DISTINCT(member_casual) FROM all_trips;`

Finding no typos here, I will do the same for rideable_type.

`SELECT DISTINCT(rideable_type) FROM all_trips;`

Next, I will be creating a new column which provides a ride_length for each entry:

```
SELECT
    started_at,
    ended_at,
    ROUND(((JULIANDAY(ended_at) - JULIANDAY(started_at)) * 1440), 2) AS ride_length
FROM all_trips;
```

After creating the ride_length column, I can check for any ride lengths that may be invalid:

```
SELECT COUNT(ride_length)
FROM
    (SELECT
        started_at,
        ended_at,
        ROUND(((JULIANDAY(ended_at) - JULIANDAY(started_at)) * 1440), 2) AS ride_length
    FROM all_trips)
WHERE ride_length < 0 OR ride_length > 1440;
```

I have detected 5,397 entries with a ride length of less than 0 or greater than 24hrs. These will be filtered out in the next step.

## Data Cleaning
Taking what we have learned in the previous stage, I will be creating a new table that filters out inaccurate or incomplete data, and calling it cleaned_trips. This table will also include new columns: ride_length, weekday, month, and start_hour.

First, I will clear any previous attempts at creating this new table:

`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cleaned_trips;`

Next, creating the new table:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cleaned_trips AS
    SELECT *,
        ROUND(((JULIANDAY(ended_at) - JULIANDAY(started_at)) * 1440), 2) AS ride_length,
        CASE CAST (STRFTIME('%w', started_at) AS INTEGER)
            WHEN 0 THEN 'Sunday'
            WHEN 1 THEN 'Monday'
            WHEN 2 THEN 'Tuesday'
            WHEN 3 THEN 'Wednesday'
            WHEN 4 THEN 'Thursday'
            WHEN 5 THEN 'Friday'
            WHEN 6 THEN 'Saturday' END AS weekday,
        CASE CAST (STRFTIME('%m', started_at) AS INTEGER)
            WHEN 1 THEN 'January'
            WHEN 2 THEN 'February'
            WHEN 3 THEN 'March'
            WHEN 4 THEN 'April'
            WHEN 5 THEN 'May'
            WHEN 6 THEN 'June'
            WHEN 7 THEN 'July'
            WHEN 8 THEN 'August'           
            WHEN 9 THEN 'September'            
            WHEN 10 THEN 'October'         
            WHEN 11 THEN 'November'
            WHEN 12 THEN 'December'
            END AS month,
        SUBSTR(started_at, 12,2) AS start_hour
    FROM all_trips
    WHERE start_station_name <> ''
        AND start_station_id <> ''
        AND end_station_name <> ''
        AND end_station_id <> ''
        AND end_lat <> ''
        AND end_lng <> '';
```

This new table has 4,494,681 rows, meaning 1,334,349 entries have been removed before analysis.

## Data Analysis
Before diving deep into the data, I will create a few tables that show the dataset at a glance.

First, a table that shows the breakdown of users:

```
SELECT member_casual, COUNT(member_casual) AS total_trips
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY member_casual;
```

Next, a table that shows the breakdown of bike types being used by each user type:

```
SELECT rideable_type, member_casual, COUNT(rideable_type) AS total_rides
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY member_casual, rideable_type;
```

A table showing the average ride length of each user type:

```
SELECT member_casual, AVG(ride_length) AS average_ride_length
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY member_casual;
```

Now, I will be taking a look at when both user groups use Cyclistic bikes, starting by breaking it down by hour:

```
SELECT member_casual, start_hour, COUNT(start_hour) AS total_rides
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY member_casual, start_hour;
```

Now, breaking down ridership by weekday for both groups:

```
SELECT member_casual, month, COUNT(month) AS total_rides
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY month, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, started_at;
```

Finally, showing when rides are taken by month:

```
SELECT member_casual, month, COUNT(month) AS total_rides
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY month, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, started_at;
```

Now that we know how ridership differs over time, we will take a look at how long each user type uses a bike, on average.

First, checking hourly breakdown of ride length:

```
SELECT member_casual, start_hour, AVG(ride_length) AS average_ride_length
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY start_hour, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, start_hour;
```

Next, average ride length by weekday:

```
SELECT member_casual, weekday, AVG(ride_length) AS average_ride_length
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY weekday, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, started_at;
```

And now, average ride length by month:

```
SELECT member_casual, month, AVG(ride_length) AS average_ride_lenth
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY month, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, started_at;
```

Now that we have looked at when rides are taken and for how long, we will take a look at where.

I’ll create a top ten list for the most popular starting stations, first for members:

```
SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(ride_id) AS start_station_total
FROM cleaned_trips
WHERE member_casual = 'member'
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY start_station_total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Then, for casual riders:

```
SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(ride_id) AS start_station_total
FROM cleaned_trips
WHERE member_casual = 'casual'
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY start_station_total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Now, I will create a table that pairs each of the starting locations by name, and assigning them to a latitude and longitude. This is done by averaging latitude and longitudinal values, establishing the coordinates of each individual station.

```
SELECT start_station_name, member_casual,
  AVG(start_lat) AS start_lat,
  AVG(start_lng) AS start_lng,
  COUNT(ride_id) AS total_trips
FROM cleaned_trips
GROUP BY start_station_name, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, total_trips DESC;
```

Now that we’ve gained some important insights on our data, it’s time to create visuals and insights on everything we’ve learned so far.

## Data Visualized

[See my interactive vizualization here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticAnalysisWorkbook_2/CyclisticUserAnalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link  )
        

## Key Findings
- We see a significant influx of member rides at 8 am and 5 pm, indicating that **members tend to rely on Cyclistic bikes for their daily commute**.
- In contrast, casual riders are most active on weekends, suggesting that **casual riders tend to use the service for leisure**.
- **On average** casual users’ average ride length is close to double that of members, supporting the hypothesis that **casual riders’ routes are more meandering, slower, or less purpose-driven compared to members, who are likely commuting**.
- **Casual riders predominantly start their rides near Chicago’s center of tourism, whereas members exhibit a more diverse starting location preference**, which tends to be farther away from the city center. This finding further strengthens the distinction between commuters and sight-seers among the two user types.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings listed above, there is a fundamental difference in the purpose of rides taken by both user groups. These purposes must be taken into account when developing marketing campaigns to convert casual riders into members.

- Develop a new “Weekend Pass” product. This could be **a new membership type that caters to the casual riders’ existing habits of riding on the weekends**. This creates a middle ground for prospective members and will generate recurring revenue from the casual rider group.
- **Develop marketing materials that focus on the potential for commuting**. Casual riders may not have ever considered using the bikes for anything other than leisure, and advertisements highlighting this possibility could make the difference.
- In order to target the casual rider, we can use the data to determine when and where to reach them:
    - **Between the months of March and October**, when Cyclistic is used the most.
    - **During the weekends**, when casual riders are most active.
    - **Near Streeter Dr & Grand Ave**, by far the most popular station used by casual riders.
